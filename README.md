## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) - React Library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - React Library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React Animation Library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript superset language
- [Sass](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - CSS superset language
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I gained a tremendous amount of experience working with React and its libraries. I also learned how to combine React with TypeScript in practice, so that everything works and is typed correctly. I also learned about Framer Motion and how it is used in projects to provide smooth, natural animations. I believe that this project solidified my knowledge that I gained in the course "React - The Complete Guide 2023" from Academind.

### Continued development

After this project, I would like to start learning the Next.JS Framework, and then create a large full-stack application based just on this framework, with UI/UX design prepared by me.

### Useful resources

- [Framer Motion layout animations](https://www.framer.com/motion/layout-animations/) - Here I learned a lot about layout animation in Framer Motion, and it helped me understand how it works.
